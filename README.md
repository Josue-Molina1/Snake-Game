# Overview

So this is a simple snake game, just like the one a lot of us played on a Nokia phone back on the day. 
It consists of the same rules, try to get as many apples as possible before you crash into yourself! :D

I created this app since I felt like this was a better way to go about a game I actually know how it works, without it being super hard
and made me want to drop the project, it's also fun to build a game, this was nothing to crazy, but hey, it's my first Python game, right?

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
