# Overview

So this is a simple snake game, just like the one a lot of us played on a Nokia phone back on the day. 
It consists of the same rules, try to get as many apples as possible before you crash into yourself! :D

I created this app since I felt like this was a better way to go about a game I actually know how it works, without it being super hard
and made me want to drop the project, it's also fun to build a game, this was nothing to crazy, but hey, it's my first Python game, right?

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used VS Code and Python with the Pygame module, I tried trying to add a database to it, but failed on the attempt, that with the purpose
of keeping an all-time highscore, I'll get it to work on the future. 
I used the Pygame module because it has a big community, and I was more prompt to find answers to my questions using it, I also used 
the random module, to generate a random "Apple" anywhere on my canvas to keep the game moving. 

It was really fun to use Pygame, I hope I can create a rogue-like in the future.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I would like to make it so the snake can travel through walls, just like on the Nokia game, I had some issues with the coordinates. 
* I would like to add different colors a different background and many other things like a more realistic snake. 
* Implement a database to keep records of the top scorers on the game.
